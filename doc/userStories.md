### User Stories

User stories are concise, simple descriptions of a feature from an end-user perspective. They help in understanding the requirements and functionalities of a system. Each user story typically follows the format: "As a [role], I want [goal/desire] so that [reason/benefit]."

1. As a developer, I need to read the contents of the `password.txt` file containing email addresses and passwords.
   
2. As a developer, I need to encrypt the passwords from `password.txt` and store them in a new file, `password.enc.txt`, in an email:hash format.

3. As a developer, I need to upload the encrypted information from `password.enc.txt` into the MongoDB database using Mongoose.

4. As a user, I want to input my email address and password into the application and receive a `true` response if the provided email and password match the encrypted information in the MongoDB database.

5. As a user, I want the application to return `false` if the provided email address is not found in the password file, if the provided password does not match the corresponding email address, or if the provided email address exists but has an empty or null password.
